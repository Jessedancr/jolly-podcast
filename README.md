# jolly_podcast

STEPS TO RUN PROJECT
- Clone repo
- Run 'flutter pub get' to get packages used
- Run the app using 'flutter run' or the play button in vs code

CHOSEN STATE MANAGEMENT APPROACH
- BLoC

ASSUMPTIONS MADE
- I called the top jolly podcasts endpoint and I assumed that on clicking on a single podcast, you'll be taken to a screen which shows the episodes in that 

IF GIVEN MORE TIME I WOULD IMPROVE THE FOLLOWING:
- Playing a podcast when the app is on the background
